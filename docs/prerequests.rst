================

- QuST includes a user interface for StarDist for convenience. The user who wishes to use StarDist should download and install it separatly.
- For cell-cell interaction, an additional file, human_lr_pair.csv, is required. The latest version of the file can be obtained from [CellChatDB](https://github.com/jinworks/CellChat/tree/main). An older version can be found [here](./cci_datasets/human_lr_pair.csv). Please cite below publications if you are using their works.
