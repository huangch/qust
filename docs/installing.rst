**Better extension support in QuPath v0.5!**
See [readthedocs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/0.5/docs/intro/extensions.html) for details.

To install the QuST extension, download the latest `qupath-extension-qust-[version].jar` file from [releases](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-qust/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory.
The extension will then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).
